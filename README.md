# Fork Info

Sourced originally from [diegosucaria/node-oauth2-server](https://github.com/diegosucaria/node-oauth2-server) which was forked originally from 
[oauthjs/node-oauth2-server](https://github.com/oauthjs/node-oauth2-server). This is a sort of forward-port of the idea applied to this fork of node-oauth server. Use an override in the package.json if updating from the previous package.

# Previous Fork Info

On this fork of oauth2-server I've modified the function prototypes to include an extra optional parameter: `expReqCtx`
It is intended to pass the express request context to the internal model functions, which will allow for example to use a distributed logging solution.

example of usage:


call the module functions like this:
```
...
oauth.token(request, response, null, null, req).then((token)=> {
...
oauth.authenticate(request, response,{scope: scopes}, null, req).then((token)=> {
```

then, in your model, add the extra `expReqCtx` parameter

```
...
function getUser(username, password, req)
...
function verifyScope(token, scopes, req)
...
```

I've added the req parameter to all the grant-types and all the functions in the model.
# @node-oauth/oauth2-server

Complete, compliant and well tested module for implementing an OAuth2 server in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

NOTE: This project has been forked from [oauthjs/node-oauth2-server](https://github.com/oauthjs/node-oauth2-server) and is a continuation due to the project appearing to be abandoned. Please see [our issue board](https://github.com/node-oauth/node-oauth2-server/issues) to talk about next steps and the future of this project.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @node-oauth/oauth2-server
```

The *@node-oauth/oauth2-server* module is framework-agnostic but there are several officially supported wrappers available for popular HTTP server frameworks such as [Express](https://npmjs.org/package/express-oauth-server) and [Koa](https://npmjs.org/package/koa-oauth-server). If you're using one of those frameworks it is strongly recommended to use the respective wrapper module instead of rolling your own.


## Features

- Supports `authorization_code`, `client_credentials`, `refresh_token` and `password` grant, as well as *extension grants*, with scopes.
- Can be used with *promises*, *Node-style callbacks*, *ES6 generators* and *async*/*await* (using [Babel](https://babeljs.io)).
- Fully [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749.html) and [RFC 6750](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750.html) compliant.
- Implicitly supports any form of storage, e.g. *PostgreSQL*, *MySQL*, *MongoDB*, *Redis*, etc.
- Complete [test suite](https://github.com/node-oauth/node-oauth2-server/tree/master/test).
